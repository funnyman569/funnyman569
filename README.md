Hi! My name is Hayden Harris. I am a biomedical science major. I often get the question, "why are you learning programming?" since people in my field often don't learn much in software development. I want to be able to connect two very different worlds to provide solutions that are yet to be discovered do to the lack of comprehension between both industries. Both Biomedical Science and Software Engineering require high-level knowledge of both theoretical and application to create solutions. By holding knowledge of both worlds, I hope to craft solutions otherwise unseen.

Hi! My name is Hayden Harris. I have a degree in Biomedical Science with a Minor in Computer Programming and Chemistry. I often am asked, "Why are you learning programming?". People in my field often don't learn much in software development as the sciences are complex enough by themselves. However, I want to be able to connect two very different worlds to provide solutions that are yet to be discovered due to the lack of comprehension and shared knowledge between the two industries. Both biomedical science and software engineering require a high level of knowledge of both theoretical and application to create solutions. By holding knowledge of both worlds, I hope to craft solutions otherwise unseen.
